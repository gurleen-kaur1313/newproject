This app is made in flutter and I have used Firebase dynamic database for authentication and to fetch courses information within a few seconds in real time.
As the user clicks on any course it is added to users dashboard immediately for him to access it the next time he logs in the application. 
The app is fully responsive with an interactive ui.
